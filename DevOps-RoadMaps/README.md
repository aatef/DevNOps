Remember, DevOps is not just about tools; it's a cultural shift that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation. Continuously seek feedback and adapt your practices accordingly. This plan should provide a solid foundation, but your learning journey should extend far beyond these 90 days. Stay curious and keep exploring new DevOps practices and technologies as they emerge.
