DevNOps : We serve devops with coffee

Mastering DevOps is a comprehensive journey that involves both technical and cultural aspects. Here's a 90-day plan to help you progressively learn and apply DevOps practices through hands-on experience:

Week 1: Building Foundations

- Day 0: Getting ready for DevOps Learning and Practice

    - DevOps Prerequisites Course - Getting started with DevOps by FreeCodeCamp.org

Week 1-2: Understanding DevOps Principles

    Read books like "The Phoenix Project" and "Continuous Delivery."
    Watch introductory DevOps webinars and videos.
    Familiarize yourself with DevOps-related terminology and concepts.

Week 3-4: Setting Up Your Dev Environment

    Install and configure a Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS).
    Learn basic command-line operations.
    Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) and create a repository.
    Practice basic Git commands (commit, push, pull).

Month 2: Essential Tools and Practices

Week 5-6: Automation and Configuration Management

    Learn the basics of infrastructure as code (IaC) with tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
    Set up a virtualization environment using VirtualBox or Docker.
    Write Dockerfiles and create containers for simple applications.

Week 7-8: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

    Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Travis CI.
    Create a sample application and automate its build and deployment process.
    Practice writing unit tests for your code.

Month 3: Advanced DevOps Practices

Week 9-10: Cloud Platforms and Orchestration

    Explore cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
    Learn about container orchestration with Kubernetes.
    Deploy a sample application on a cloud platform and manage its resources.

Week 11-12: Monitoring and Incident Response

    Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
    Create alerting rules and dashboards.
    Simulate and respond to incidents in your environment.

Throughout the 90 Days: Soft Skills and Collaboration

    Join DevOps-related forums, communities, or meetups to network and learn from experts.
    Collaborate with others on real-world projects, perhaps open-source contributions or freelance work.
    Document your progress and experiences in a blog or personal journal.

Remember, DevOps is not just about tools; it's a cultural shift that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation. Continuously seek feedback and adapt your practices accordingly. This plan should provide a solid foundation, but your learning journey should extend far beyond these 90 days. Stay curious and keep exploring new DevOps practices and technologies as they emerge.
